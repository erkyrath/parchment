Change log started August 2009.

November 2011
================================================================================
ZVM is now the default Z-Machine VM.
Changed the VM launching system so that each VM now provides a Runner (or else it will use the default).
Gnusto uses ZVM's UI class. The old ZUI is gone!
Wrote a new IO system called StructIO, which is used by both ZVM and Gnusto. Eventually I hope to make a Glk wrapper for it too.

Added the ifvms.js ZVM engine.

May 2011

================================================================================
 + Zarf made many changes to Gnusto to remove signed data from the memory, and correct for overflows etc.
 + Simplified file.download_to_array(). Cross origin requests are no longer made.
 + If an array is passed to download_to_array() the second element is treated as a backup base64 file.

 + Updated Gnusto with the fix for the illegal object number bug.
